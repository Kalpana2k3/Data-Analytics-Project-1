# Data-Analytics-Project-1
This is an ETL ( Extract, Transform and Load) and Analytics project guided by @Ankitbansal6.

It includes processes like 
             (A. DATA DOWNLOADING & EXTRACTING   
             B. DATA CLEANING & TRANSFORMING
             C. LOADING DATA TO SERVER
             D. QUERYING & ANALYSING DATA)


 A. DATA DOWNLOADING & EXTRACTING :
     (kaggle dataset, Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook)
      -Using Kaggle import, I downloaded the data into the Jupyter Notebook.
      -And Extracted it to python using Pandas library for further process

B. DATA CLEANING & TRANSFORMING :
     (Pandas library)
      - Using pandas, I cleaned the data and modified it as per my need for further analysis.

C. LOADING DATA TO SERVER :
     (pandas, Sql Alchemy, PostgreSQL)
      - Established the connection between the server and python using Sql Alchemy and appended
        the data to the server by creating a table in the Database

D. QUERYING & ANALYSING DATA :
      (Sql, PostgreSQL)
     - Analysed the data with some queries by using CTE and so on.
     - Some of the queries are,
               [ 1. Finding top 10 highest revenue generating products
                2. Finding top 5 highest selling products in each region
                3. Finding month over month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 sales(eg:jan 2022 vs jan 2023)
                4. Which sub category has highest growth by profit in 2023 compared to 2022 ]
